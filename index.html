					<h1>About</h1>
					<p>
						This is the home of the world-famous Flat Earth Society, a place for free thinkers and the intellectual exchange of ideas. This website hosts information and serves as an archive for Flat Earth Theory. It also offers an opportunity to discuss this with the Flat Earth community on our forums.

						<h3>Why Would People Lie About The Shape Of The Earth?</h3>
						<p>
							There are three common explanations for this, but in the end without toppling the Planar Conspiracy there is no real way to know.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>To Maintain Legitimacy: During the Cold War we faked the moon landing. Shortly after they realized the reason they could not reach the moon was due to the flatness of the Earth. They were stuck in a lie, and had to continue it or lose legitimacy of our governments. Even today we would still hold onto this lie due to role Science plays in our ruling government.</li>
							<li>To hide the truth of the Bible.</li>
							<li>To Gain Power and Money: By siphoning off the space budgets and denying the world the resources of the Antarctic they gain a considerable amount of power and wealth.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>What About Seasons?</h3>
						<p>
							The radius of the sun's orbit around the Earth's axis symmetry varies throughout the year, being smallest when summer is in the northern annulus and largest when it is summer in the southern annulus. Additionally it also raises and lowers. This causes the effect of the sun appearing to move in a figure eight throughout a year.
						</p>

					<div class="question">
						<h3>What about Day/Night and Sunrise/Sunset?</h3>
						<p>The sun simply illuminates only a portion of the earth at a time. This also explains timezones as we can then see the path of the Sun, a circle above the flat earth.</p>

					<div class="question">
						<h3>Can't you see the Curvature from an Airplane?</h3>
						<p>No. Even if the Earth was a globe this would be an impossibility. We have testimonies from several pilots saying that no curvature can be seen at Commercial Airline heights. It has been suggested that airplane windows serve to distort the view of passengers and make them believe they see curvature when indeed there is none. This was likely a ploy by early airline companies to sell more tickets.</p>

					<div class="question">
						<h3>What about Gravity?</h3>
						<p>
							Gravity as a theory is false. Objects simply fall. 
							<br> <br>
							In the flat earth community there are several theories as to why this happens. Some attempt to explain this with use of mechanics like electromagnetism, density, or pressure. Others make use of traditional mathematics, such as the infinite plane model, and others a new look at the problem - such as the non-euclidean model.
							<br> <br>
							What is certain is sphere earth gravity is not tenable in any way shape or form.
